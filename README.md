# Evolution Simulation

An experimental evolution simulation with simple RNN-controlled agents
in a shared environment.

## Features
- Shared-world, shared-time multi-agent simulation
- Recurrent neural network (RNN) controllers
- Emergent foraging behavior
- Renewable food ecology
- Real-time visualization using Pygame

## Current State
- Single-species foraging
- No hard-coded behaviors
- Population-level competence under scarcity

## Planned
- Predator–prey dynamics
- Agent–agent interactions

## Running the Simulation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
